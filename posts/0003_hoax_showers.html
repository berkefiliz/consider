                        Trickery with human language is as old as humans
                        themselves. Every time I think of modern clickbaits, I
                        get reminded of
                        <a
                            href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/iceland-greenland-name-swap"
                            >Greenlight and Iceland</a
                        >, which is no more than a marketing scheme with a great
                        backstory. No one would prefer to move to some place
                        named Iceland especially with the rising energy costs.
                        This way they can avoid overpopulation in the small
                        island named Iceland, which fittingly sounds like
                        someone forgot the drop the S while reading the word
                        <i>island</i>. Conversely, if an adventurous 21st
                        century sailor who refuses satellite imagery and photos
                        would be greeted with immeasurable disappointment upon
                        coming to close contact of the so-called green land.

                        Now, sitting by my computer and proudly criticizing
                        outside world from the comfort of my chair, I feel the
                        same kind of disappointment from time to time. It has
                        not been long since I have clicked on an interesting
                        article title to find out that the contents explain the
                        complete opposite of what the title promised. Sadly,
                        grabbing myself from the screens does not solve the
                        issue. Our language itself is poisoned with a disease
                        called false promises. In this post, I would like to
                        elaborate on the nitpicky details of the English
                        language that bother me on a daily basis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We take suffixes for granted. If I would like to print
                        24 copies of
                        <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/puns/comments/g3elrw/it_probably_did/"
                            >my favourite meme</a
                        >, then I need to take a quick trip to my
                        <i>printer</i>. If I realize that the room is a bit cold
                        on the way there, then I will need to start the
                        <i>heater</i>. To survive the inherent boringness of
                        messing with upgraded Excel sheets all day, I would
                        probably play some rock on my music <i>player</i>. If
                        Spotify blesses me with a nice album discovery, I show
                        that album to a friend by using a <i>showe</i>-- wait
                        no!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is where the frustration begins to unfold. The
                        language is built on simple premises yet an unfortunate
                        string of characters create a visual trap for the
                        simple-minded people like me. A systematic lie misguides
                        me to believe that a shower is a tool that is used for
                        displays. On a good day I would call this a false
                        advertisement, but labeling the issue will not mend my
                        crushed expectations. Now I have to sit down and take
                        the pain of this realization to my grave, silently
                        crying on the cold and lonely corners of the room.

                    <p>
                        I wish the name is at least partially correct too. A
                        shower, for the most part, is located in the most hidden
                        corner of the house. Sometimes it is behind a lock and
                        sometimes it is covered with a curtain or a blurry
                        glass. Its intended use is the complete opposite of what
                        the name suggests. A cruel real-life clickbait, if we
                        may. And we support this naming convention by not
                        speaking up. We are as guilty as the people who let this
                        mistake slide. What's next? Are we renaming speakers
                        <i>silencers</i>? Or freezers <i>burners</i>? Where does
                        it stop?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Maybe I need to take my time and put down the pitchforks
                        before I declare war against whoever is maintaining the
                        English language. This is no more than mere coincidence
                        as the pattern "-er" is quite a common occurence at the
                        end of words. I believe common sense is a great tool to
                        deal with it for most cases. The genuine problem starts
                        when a similar phenomenon occurs in situations where
                        context is not helpful.

                        are also known as antagonyms, auto-antonyms, and words

                    <p>
                        <a href="/index.html">Consider</a> this scenario: There
                        are three generals in a room, each from a different
                        country that are in war against each other. General A is
                        very happy as they have been winning battle after
                        battle. You are sitting there as General B, nervously
                        waiting for a statement from General A. You have made
                        some secret agreements with General C. You believe if
                        you can fight together for long enough, your common
                        enemy will fall. Then you and General C can both sit
                        down and come to terms in peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To your surprise, General A looks at you and says "I
                        will call all of my troops to make a final attack on
                        your capital city." You are aware of the devastating
                        effects of this and you are afraid you will not be able
                        to hold the castle for long. General A has the largest
                        army amongst those in the room and there is no way you
                        can fight against the entire army by yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        General C looks at you, yells "I will back up!" and
                        swiftly leaves the room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is singlehandedly the worst response you could get.
                        Now you are thinking. What did they mean by that? Are
                        you witnessing a betrayal and General C's troops are
                        going to back up and surrender? Or are they also
                        acknowledging the grim announcement from General A and
                        promising you that they will be there to back you up?
                        Because in this stupid hypothetical universe (in which
                        generals reveal their entire plan to each other as if
                        this is an anime episode) the fastest way of
                        communication is still by letter, you have no choice
                        other than to back up yourself. No, like, I mean,
                        surrender.

                        Maybe I am thinking too much. I do not know at what
                        stage "pointing at issues in language" turns into
                        nitpicking and overthinking. It could be that such words
                        are not a threat to our society (yet), but look at some
                        other words that have two contradicting meanings and
                        tell me they are not common at all. How can I not care?
