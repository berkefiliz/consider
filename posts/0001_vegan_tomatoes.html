                        There is a very thin line between being that person who
                        keeps every detail to themselves as if it is a
                        government secret, and being one who has to explain
                        every process between the creation of the universe and
                        why they were very upset when they left McDonald's at
                        4:37PM on a rainy Saturday evening right before Gerald's
                        twenty-fourth birthday party to take place in Vondelpark
                        near its Amsterveenseweg entrance. Sometimes I believe
                        these people are the #1 reason behind the increasing
                        baseball bat sales and why we can't have nice things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As annoying as it is, these people are not giving any
                        incorrect information. Neither of these acts can be
                        classified as an action to break the invisible social
                        trust pact between two parties. At least, not for me.
                        Today I would like to focus on the elaborate
                        storytellers of this simple world and explore the
                        absurdity of our human language.

                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        <a href="/index.html">Consider</a> this scenario: You
                        are heading home from a busy day of your nine to five
                        job, just to realize the past-you has not been
                        considerate enough to feed the now-you. There is a
                        supermarket down the road and you think to yourself: "I
                        could do some red pasta today!" Luckily the pasta aisle
                        is stocked despite the density of student rooms in the
                        neighborhood. You grab two packs of those weirdly shaped
                        carb sticks and start walking to where the fresh goods
                        are. As you internally <i>woo!</i> for finding tomatoes,
                        one detail catches your eye: "Vegan tomatoes, &euro;2.39
                        per kg."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There it is. Now you are wondering whether you are still
                        at a hangover state due to Gerald's birthday party or
                        your sanity is being targeted by a cruel prank. You look
                        around for the hidden cameras until you spot a sign
                        informing you that the supermarket is geared with
                        security cameras 24/7. Unsure, you wave at a worker and
                        ask where you can find the non-vegan tomatoes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The worker looks equally puzzled why you may be asking
                        such a question, but is willing to help you out. He
                        squeezes his eyes and hesitantly asks "Madame, do you
                        mean the ready meals with tomato sauce? They are right
                        on--" The internal realization that the sign is serious
                        disassociates from the talk momentarily and you find
                        yourself lost on the labeling preferences of your local
                        supermarket. You point at the sign and wait for an
                        explanation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nope. As silent as he is, he looks at the tag and then
                        meets eyes again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Why is it labeled as... vegan?" you ask. You sense some
                        slight frustration behind his face. It's a familiar look
                        that tells you he's supposed to be somewhere, do
                        something. Not this. He already deals with the weirdest
                        of customers every day. He's seen worse. To everyone's
                        benefit, Ryan is a kind soul: "Because our tomatoes do
                        not have any animal products. You can find this sticker
                        on other items that does not contain, say, dairy and
                        meat products." He shrugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You feel as if you unlocked a quest in your life. Your
                        existence drifts away as you take a gentle look at that
                        pale blue dot filled with insufferable vagueness and
                        mystery. You think of every struggle and victory you
                        have ever had in your life. The unnecessary burden of
                        all there is. The dread fills you with an urge to scream
                        at the soulless letters. To find an answer. To find out
                        what horrible precedent event had to occur before this
                        sign had to be there. To learn who or what was hurt
                        until someone had to specify you would not be finding
                        this piece of vegetable at a butcher's or a
                        cheeseseller's. (Is that a word?) You take a deep breath
                        and decide to not deal with this on a Monday night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You gently step towards your car. Your hunger is long
                        gone.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        You know, that feeling? What the tag says is factually
                        100% correct, yet it generates more suspicion than it
                        resolves. It makes you wonder at what point adding extra
                        detail to your description becomes an indication of
                        self-defence, confession or panic. If I walked up to you
                        and said "I am definitely not a murderer," would your
                        first response be along the lines of relief? If I
                        realize your panic and add "No, I swear I am not!" would
                        you feel any better? (By the way, I swear I am not!)
                    </p>

                        I guess this has to do with

                        >. More specifically, maxim of quantity. As we
                        communicate with each other, we rely on unwritten
                        standards in our expressions regardless of our language.
                        Maxim of quantity expects us to follow the assumption
                        that we are not giving any more information than
                        necessary. Not too much, not too little. Personally, I
                        find the violation of this very humorous in cases
                        similar to what I have discussed already.

                        It does not need to be humorous though. If I told a
                        waiter that I do not want any coffee in the green tea I
                        am ordering, they will most likely assume I am on some
                        substance before they find any humor in that. They will
                        ask me to repeat to avoid potential miscommunication.
                        You would assume giving more details about an order
                        makes everything simpler, but it does nothing other than
                        creating unnecessary confusion. As far as its flexible
                        meaning conveys, a Turkish idiom expresses the situation
                        well: You put a watermelon shell inside the donkey's
                        head.

                        For that reason, it ruined some words for me. Any full
                        sentence that has the word <i>definitely</i> now makes
                        me question my safety. "After listening to Gerald and
                        taking the wrong turn 3 times in a row, we are
                        <i>definitely</i> heading in the correct direction
                        because we adecided to use the GPS," as you tell me
                        through the phone call we have. Look, I am all for
                        acknowledging

                            >gambler's fallacy</a
                        >
                        but such a statement does not refresh my trust in
                        Gerald. The fact that you now have a way to assess if
                        you are on route does not make me feel any better about
                        this. How ironic that a word as strong and precise as
                        <i>definitely</i> has fallen a victim of something as
                        simple as overstatements.

                        Moreover, it has some unexpected effects on some of the
                        daily aspects of life. This whole thing reminds me of a
                        <a

                        huge sign saying "This product contains peanuts." These
                        signs make me genuinely wonder what previous encounter
                        by the seller got them to create the sign. It is easy to
                        laugh and live on, yet the existence of such warnings
                        indicate a fix for a loophole for those with malicious
                        intents. This is the exact reason why we have have
                        instruction manuals at the size of an encyclopedia. It
                        does not mention that you should keep your pets away
                        from the washing machine? That just asks for a dead cat
                        and a lawsuit to your company. I wish to be joking at
                        this moment, but here is a story of a man who used a
                        lawnmower as a, <i>checks notes</i>, hedge trimmer. Then
                        won.

                        Even better, the ninth picture from the same list is a
                        fridge with a note saying "This is not an exit." All of
                        a sudden, I am tempted to find that wizard which uses it
                        as a private gateway to whatever dimension wizards live
                        in. Oh well.

                        In conclusion, overstatement is a bizarre and niche
                        corner of human communication. It is sometimes humorous,
                        sometimes worrying and sometimes just a sign that our
                        species is <i>still</i> evolving. I have not created
                        this post for a reason; it's just that I keep thinking
                        for examples of the art of excruciatingly specific
                        speech in my daily life. It gives me some insight of how
                        redundancy is actually a verbal tool that is more
                        capable than, well, wasting time for everyone. I felt
                        the need to type this from the keyboard of my

                        You reach home after having to visit two grocery stores.
                        You want to get this over with, so you search for the
                        red pasta recipe online. You skim through the
                        ingredients. Some 200 grams of tomatoes, a pack of pasta
                        in the shape of your own choice, salt and some spices.
                        Seems easy, so you scroll further. A moment later, you
                        see it.
