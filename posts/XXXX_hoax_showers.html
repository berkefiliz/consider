                        Trickery with human language is as old as humans
                        themselves. Every time I think of modern clickbaits, I
                        get reminded of
                        <a
                            href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/iceland-greenland-name-swap"
                            >Greenlight and Iceland</a
                        >, which is no more than a marketing scheme with a great
                        backstory. If an adventurous 21st century sailor who
                        does not believe in satellite imagery and photos would
                        be greeted with immeasurable disappointment upon coming
                        to close contact of the so-called green land.

                        Now, sitting by my computer and proudly criticizing
                        outside world from the comfort of my chair, I feel the
                        same kind of disappointment from time to time.It has not
                        been long since I have clicked on an interesting article
                        title to find out that the contents explain the complete
                        opposite of what the title promised. Sadly, grabbing
                        myself from the screens do not solve the issue. Our
                        language itself is poisoned with a disease called false
                        promises. In this post, I would like to elaborate on the
                        nitpicky details of the English language that bother me
                        on a daily basis.

                        We take suffixes for granted. If I would like to print
                        24 copies of
                        <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/puns/comments/g3elrw/it_probably_did/"
                            >my favourite meme</a
                        >, then I need to take a quick trip to my
                        <i>printer</i>. If I realize that the room is a bit cold
                        on the way there, then I will need to start the
                        <i>heater</i>. Then I would probably play some rock on
                        my music <i>player</i>. If Spotify blesses me with a
                        nice album discovery, I show that album to a friend by
                        using a <i>showe</i>-- wait no!

                        This is where the frustration begins to unfold. The
                        language is built on simple premises yet an unfortunate
                        string of characters create a visual trap for the
                        simple-minded people like me. A systematic lie misguides
                        me to believe that a shower is a tool that is used for
                        displays. On a good day I would call this a false
                        advertisement, but labeling the issue will not mend my
                        crushed expectations. Now I have to sit down and take
                        the pain of this realization to my grave, silently
                        crying on the cold and lonely corners of the room.

                        I wish the name is at least partially correct too. A
                        shower, for the most part, is located in the most hidden
                        corner of the house. Sometimes it is behind a lock and
                        sometimes it is covered with a curtain or a blurry
                        glass. Its intended use is the complete opposite of what
                        the name suggests. And we support this naming convention
                        by not speaking up. What's next? Are we renaming
                        speakers <i>silencers</i>? Or freezers <i>burners</i>?
                        Where does it stop?

                        Maybe I need to take my time and put down the pitchforks
                        before I declare war against whoever is maintaining the
                        English language. This is no more than mere coincidence
                        as the pattern of -er is quite common at the end of
                        words. The genuine problem starts when a similar
                        phenomenon occurs intentionally or as a result of the
                        evolution of language.
