        Trickery with human language is as old as humans themselves. Every time
        I think of modern clickbaits, I get reminded of
        <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/iceland-greenland-name-swap">Greenland and Iceland</a>, which is no more than a marketing scheme with a great backstory. No
        one would prefer to move to some place named Iceland especially with the
        rising energy costs. This way they can avoid overpopulation in the small
        island named Iceland, which fittingly sounds like someone forgot the
        drop the S while reading the word <i>island</i>. Conversely, if an
        adventurous 21st century sailor who refuses satellite imagery and photos
        would be greeted with immeasurable disappointment upon coming to close
        contact of the so-called green land.

        Now, sitting by my computer and proudly criticizing outside world from
        the comfort of my chair, I feel the same kind of disappointment from
        time to time. It has not been long since I have clicked on an
        interesting article title to find out that the contents explain the
        complete opposite of what the title promised. Sadly, grabbing myself
        from the screens does not solve the issue. Our language itself is
        poisoned with a disease called false promises. In this post, I would
        like to elaborate on the nitpicky details of the English language that
        bother me on a daily basis.

        We take suffixes for granted. If I would like to print 24 copies of
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/puns/comments/g3elrw/it_probably_did/">my favourite meme</a>, then I need to take a quick trip to my <i>printer</i>. If I realize
        that the room is a bit cold on the way there, then I will need to start
        the <i>heater</i>. To survive the inherent boringness of messing with
        upgraded Excel sheets all day, I would probably play some rock on my
        music <i>player</i>. If Spotify blesses me with a nice album discovery,
        I show that album to a friend by using a <i>showe</i>-- wait no!
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where the frustration begins to unfold. The language is built on
        simple premises yet an unfortunate string of characters create a visual
        trap for the simple-minded people like me. A systematic lie misguides me
        to believe that a shower is a tool that is used for displays. On a good
        day I would call this a false advertisement, but labeling the issue will
        not mend my crushed expectations. Now I have to sit down and take the
        pain of this realization to my grave, silently crying on the cold and
        lonely corners of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish the name is at least partially correct too. A shower, for the
        most part, is located in the most hidden corner of the house. Sometimes
        it is behind a lock and sometimes it is covered with a curtain or a
        blurry glass. Its intended use is the complete opposite of what the name
        suggests. A cruel real-life clickbait, if we may. And we support this
        naming convention by not speaking up. We are as guilty as the people who
        let this mistake slide. What's next? Are we renaming speakers
        <i>silencers</i>? Or freezers <i>burners</i>? Where does it stop?

        Maybe I need to take my time and put down the pitchforks before I
        declare war against whoever is maintaining the English language. This is
        no more than mere coincidence as the pattern "-er" is quite a common
        occurence at the end of words. I believe common sense is a great tool to
        deal with it for most cases. The genuine problem starts when a similar
        phenomenon occurs in situations where context is not helpful.

        Introducing:
        <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_contranyms" target="_blank">contranyms</a>! Okay, fine, English may not be my mother tongue, but that does not
        justify this abomination. For those who don't want to click on links,
        here is the definition of a contranym according to Wiktionary:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        A contranym or contronym is a word which has two or more generally
        accepted meanings in the English language that directly or generally
        contradict each other. Such words are also known as antagonyms,
        auto-antonyms, and words having self-contradictions.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <a href="/index.html">Consider</a> this scenario: You have been chosen
        to give a long speech at the 50th year celebrations of your university
        and you are sitting by your bed in your dorm room. You are okay with
        crowds and the stage as you are a confident person; okay, maybe except
        for that one time in Gerald's birthday party. We are not going to talk
        about that, don't worry. (Your secret is my secret, shhh)
    </p>
    <p>
        This will be a big crowd though. Every year grade has over two thousand
        students. There are 5 concurrent grades. Some parents and alumni will
        join. The staff, the chef, the musicians... You are incredibly scared of
        walking up that stage and keeping the speech interesting for about 15
        minutes. How do people do it?
    </p>
    <p>
        Luckily, Gerald is there by you for motivational support. He reminds you
        of the possibility of getting up to the stage as two people and doing
        the speech together. You are surprised, as Gerald is famous for their
        lack of confidence. Curious, you ask: "What is <i>your</i> plan about
        handling all of the stress? I will walk up those stairs and thousands of
        eyes will be on me! What if I make a mistake? What if they make fun of
        me?"
    </p>
    <p>
        You see Gerald. A bit nervous and conforting, he replies: "I'll back
        up!" Then swiftly leaves the room.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are confused. Did the stress finally get to them and and they
        decided to <i>back up</i> from the suggestion? So are they not coming to
        do the speech with you? No, Gerald is mostly nice. That can't be! Of
        course they will <i>back you up</i>! They probably left the room to
        prepare something... right? You panic, as Gerald's behavior is often
        even less predictable than Dutch weather.

        Maybe I am thinking too much. I do not know at what stage "pointing at
        issues in language" turns into nitpicking and overthinking. It could be
        that such words are not a threat to our society (yet), but look at some
        other words that have two contradicting meanings and tell me they are
        not common at all. How can I not care?

        You hear your name called out. It's a nervous road but you manage to get
        to the speaker's stand. You look around, quite hopeful; however, there
        are no Geralds in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
        You voice a really horrible insult that I will not repeat here in order
        to keep the keep this post very civil. As much as I adore your
        creativity with that statement, now everything looks at you. Next time
        mute the microphone before you dare to step the unspeakable territory if
        you don't want such a grand entrance, you buffoon!
